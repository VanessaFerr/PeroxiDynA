ABOUT THIS TOOL

PeroxiDynA (Peroxisome Dynamics’ Analyses) is a tool for ImageJ that enables the quantification of peroxisome number and spatial distribution in mammalian cultured cells from 2D confocal/super-resolution microscopy images. This tool was developed by Vanessa Ferreira in the Virus-Host Cell Interactions laboratory at University of Aveiro, while trying to study peroxisome dynamics in adherent mammalian cells. 

APPLICATIONS
- Determination of peroxisomes’ area and predicted diameter
- Analysis of peroxisome spatial localization within a single cell

INSTALLATION

You should have ImageJ installed. 
1. Download the file denominated “PeroxiDynA.ijm”
2. Go to the ImageJ app folder in your computer. 
3. Move the file “PeroxiDynA.ijm” to “plugins”. 
4. Start ImageJ
5. Select “Plugins”, then select “Install”, go to the folder from step 3 and click on “PeroxiDynA.ijm”.

RUN

1. Open ImageJ
2. Open an image to process
3. Select “Plugins” and click on “PeroxiDynA”

EDIT

This macro was developed and optimized for MacOS. For Windows, the stacks are formed in a different order, therefore, please change the numbering of the peroxisomes and the nuclei channels in the corresponding coding lines.

1. Open ImageJ, select “Plugins” – “Macros” – “Edit” and edit the lines of the macro.
